### Fast Stock Forecasting
A tool for fast, secure and reliable stock forecasting. 

BeStock is written in Rust, with 4 principles in mind:
* Fast (really fast)
* Safe
* Reliable
* Consistent

## first roadmap: can't be basic than this.
- [x] Naive demand forecast (mean sales + 1 standard deviation)
- [ ] Random sales generator for testing
- [ ] A process that takes all the sales info and stores the suggested stock in a SQL database
- [ ] A GUI for user interaction with suggested stock
